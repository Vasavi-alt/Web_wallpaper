	<p style="font-size:25px;">Our goal is to transform the office/house spaces with 
                our wall coverings & become the best company in
                India in terms of customer satisfaction.Since I was 25 years old, I have been passionate about the structures and colours of marble.
		During my training as a plasterer I came into contact with friends who had been to the art
 		academy and invited me to take part in a course in marble painting.
		Soon I realised that painting was not going to be my thing, but the spark to matter was there.
		As plaster with pigments would become my medium, I was given reading to study Scagliola, an art form that dominated the artistic plasterers in the 18th centurie
		Again my curiosity was aroused, but because of the complex process of Scagliola I knew for sure that I would start my own search.
		Thousands of hours and seconds later I can say that I have now found my own way to make certain creations marbles in pigmented plaster.
